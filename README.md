# 3DFrogger

### Requirements:

The entire project can be found here: https://github.com/nischalshrestha/3DFrogger

If you want to run it locally on a machine clone it with git.

The main requirement is threejs and a way to run a local server if running on a
local machine since Chrome will complain about file access permission for texture
and obj loading. The project is tested with the program http-server.

If you run the program with the link below, you don't need to run a local server.

You can play with it here: https://nischalshrestha.github.io/3DFrogger/

NOTE: The only files included for submission is the main html file, which holds
the code, the thumbnail for the game, and this README. Please refer to my github
link above to run the program, and look at the other files since they are too
large to submit here.

### Description:

This is a 3D version of the classic arcade game, Frogger.

The rules are similar to the classic game, where the objective is to not get hit
by a vehicle, land on the water and grass on the other side. The frogger also
cannot stay on the log or turtle for too long because it can die if it hits the edge.
The main goal is to get to the other side and land on one of the swamps.

The frog is safe on the turtle shells and the logs and have to use them to get to
the swamps. Collect five frogs and progress to the next level, where objects move
faster with each level.

### Extra Credits Implemented:

- 2% Track and display score.
- 3% When a certain number of frogs cross the road and river safely, a new level appears.
- 4% Add at least one additional vehicle (e.g. truck) or creature (e.g. turtle). Ensure that its behavior differs from other vehicles or creatures (e.g. speed or diving).
- 5% Sound and music. On certain game events, e.g. game start, movement, collision, etc. play a sound effect. Some sounds are here and here, but feel free to use your own.
